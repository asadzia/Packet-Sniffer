A packet sniffer created using the pcap library in C.

The default setting allows one to read live data from ALL the interfaces. 

The -i option is used to read from a particular interface.
The -f option is used to read recorded data from a file. 
The -d option is used to set the interval for displaying the data.
The -N option is used to adjust the number of talkers we want to observe exchanging the packets.
